# F1-Analysis

## Introduction

Formula 1 (F1) is a premier motorsport competition that produces extensive data from races, including telemetry, car performance metrics, driver information, and race results. This project leverages data analysis techniques to gain deeper insights into F1 data, aiming to enhance team performance, optimize race strategies, and improve race outcomes. The dataset, current as of the 2023 Bahrain Grand Prix, is analyzed using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

## Data Source

The dataset for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions. It encompasses detailed information about F1 drivers, seasons they participated in, race data, and the points they earned.

## File Structure

- **F1DriversDataset.csv**: Contains the raw dataset in CSV format.
- **index.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook used for data analysis.
- **plots**: Directory containing plots generated from the data analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset contained missing values and inconsistent data types. Data cleaning was performed using the Pandas library to remove missing values and ensure consistent data types suitable for analysis.

## Data Analysis

The dataset was analyzed to uncover insights and answer various questions related to F1 races. The analysis includes correlation studies and visualizations using the Matplotlib library. Key questions explored include:

1. **Distribution of Driver Nationalities**: What is the distribution of driver nationalities in the dataset?
2. **Correlation Between Seasons and Wins**: What is the correlation between the number of seasons a driver participates in and their number of race wins?
3. **Correlation Between Podiums and Pole Positions**: What is the correlation between the number of podium finishes and the number of pole positions for drivers who are or have been champions?
4. **Factors for Becoming a Champion**: What does it take to be a champion?

## Conclusions

The analysis provides intriguing insights into F1 races, the drivers, and championship victories. These findings are detailed in the Jupyter notebooks and visualized in the plots directory.
